        <h2>Example project: Damped Driven Pendulum</h4>
            Chaotic dynamics in the driven, damped harmonic oscillator. The simulation below is a visualization of some
            work that I did in my degree. It shows the precession of a pendulum about a fixed point whilst being
            affected by not only gravity, but by a damping force - typically due to air resistance or friction with the
            pivot, and a periodic driving force, applied as the cosine of the product of the driving frequency and the
            time.

            The Phase Portrait graph is a representation of the pendulum's motion in phase space, with the vertical axis
            being velocity and the horizontal axis being the angle. Note that this graph is wrapped from -pi to pi.

            The Poincare Section is a periodic sampling of the datapoints in line with the driving frequency of the
            pendulum. This results in a shape being produced that is fractal in nature and is a visual representation of
            a Strange Attractor. In case you are interested in reproducing this result, the variables are: Driving
            frequency: 0.67, Damping coefficient: 2.0, Driving strength: 1.15.
